# Obtaining AWS Certification
One person’s experience passing the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam.

I realized that we are now utilizing AWS to such an extent that we want formally recognized abilities in our team to handle it. Therefore I opted to pursue AWS Certification. We’ve been utilizing their services for a long time, but we’ve recently been pushing the envelope and putting in larger and larger workloads.
The AWS certification ladder includes two significant levels of certification: ‘associate’ and ‘professional,’ but there is also an introductory certification of ‘cloud practitioner’ and a rising number of specialty certifications.
I chose to start with the most basic one to get my feet wet and understand how the process works. At the time, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to pursue a full certification.
Obtaining AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification

The courses on offer were approachable and not overly complex or time-consuming to complete. After studying the videos for a few hours, I signed up for the Netcom learning AWS certification course.
After completing their course, I was satisfied that my knowledge was adequate to take the exam, so I signed up to take it . However, I recognized that my depth of knowledge of the various services was insufficient for me to feel comfortable taking the exam, so I studied the remaining tutorials they gave me before taking the exam.
I clicked to begin after scanning my ID and receiving permission to start from the observer. The questions have a format very similar to that of the practice exam, and the questions were similar. So far, everything is going well.
After around 30 questions, I anticipated the exam to conclude as quickly as the practice exam, but it did not. The questions just kept pouring in. I inquired of the observer as to the number of inquiries, but they, too, were unsure. I became irritated with the length of the exam, but the difficulty was exactly what I expected, and the topics did not deviate from the training I had received.
Finally, it was discovered that the number of questions was 64, precisely like the RAM on my old Commodore 64. This was the only major surprise of the examination. I had anticipated 25–30 questions but received 64. Aside from that, the test represented the level of expertise sought by the certification; broad functional knowledge of the AWS product portfolio. If you’ve been using AWS for a while, the exam won’t be too tricky, but you should go through the course before taking the exam because the AWS environment has grown significantly.

Obtaining AWS Solutions Architect Certification

With my practitioner exam results giving me a lot of confidence, I decided to pursue one of the Associate certifications. If the first level was so simple, how difficult could the next to be? I went back to the same sites I had used before and looked at some example questions. It all seemed doable, so I decided to go for it.
The practice exam was a harsh reality check. I became more serious now. I went around for some decent preparation material and discovered that my pals Netcom Learning had excellent-looking materials.
My first attempt at the practice exam was a harsh reality check. The passing grade for the exam is 70%. However, I only received 40%!!
Fortunately for me, Netcom Learning provides a large selection of highly-rated AWS courses.

The first step was to obtain some clasroom full time training at Netcom Learning’s instructor-led courses. Fortunately, Netcom Learning provides a large selection of highly-rated AWS courses for a great deal.
I chose an AWS Certified Solutions Architect — Associate 2020 course developed by the same people that prepared for the practice test that I took.
After going over some of the fundamentals and delving into areas where I knew I was lacking, I took another practice exam to determine where I stood. My expectations were relatively high. I felt pretty confident after studying more than I had for anything in years.
Even the practice examinations, however, are intimidating. You have little more than two hours to complete the exam, and I required most of that time to finish. My second attempt earned a score of 85%!

Steps to follow
I briefly contemplated taking the Professional test after passing the Associate exam. Then I remembered how difficult the Associate exam was.
Overall, it was fun to do some study again, and I believe I will eventually climb that mountain.
